# Man Cave -  Breaking the stigma

Man Cave is a safe place to go for young men on how to cope easier with mental health. Man Cave has been developed as part of Code Institute's Full Stack Development for the AI Augmented Developer as my 1st ever project. This project is made by using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. Men's Mental Health is a something that I believe in a lot as young man who battled my with own mental health in the past it was a no brainer to cover this topic for my first project.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

User one:
As an individual feeling overwhelmed by life challenges,
I want to access mental health resources and helplines,
So that I can get professional support when needed.

User Two Emotional Healing Articles and Videos:
As someone dealing with emotional pain,
I want to find articles and videos about emotional healing,
So that I can learn ways to recover and move forward.

User three as a man considering therapy but unsure:
I want to read success stories of others who have benefitted from therapy,
So that I can feel more confident about seeking professional help.




## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Man Cave Palette](<documentation/colour palette.jpg>)

I chose this colour palette as I think it is a nice warm welcoming palette.


### Typography

I chose these fonts as I thought they looked informative and welcoming. I used Poppins for any Headings, Rozha One for any sub headings and Enriqueta for any paragraphs.

### Imagery

For Images I used AI to generate the images. I used a combo of Adobe Firefly and Microsoft Co-pilot.


### Wireframes

I made my wireframes using Balsamiq.

### Future Implementations

I would add a page for a general mental health questionnaire for users to take when they visit the page. This would trigger them to get help if they mark lower then a certain score.

In my project I have aria-labels and names attached to all my links for screen readers.
