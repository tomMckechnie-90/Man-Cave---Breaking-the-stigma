# Man Cave -  Breaking the stigma

Man Cave is a safe place to go for young men on how to cope easier with mental health. Man Cave has been developed as part of Code Institute's Full Stack Development for the AI Augmented Developer as my 1st ever project. This project is made by using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. Men's Mental Health is a something that I believe in a lot as young man who battled my with own mental health in the past it was a no brainer to cover this topic for my first project.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

User one:
As an individual feeling overwhelmed by life challenges,
I want to access mental health resources and helplines,
So that I can get professional support when needed.

User Two Emotional Healing Articles and Videos:
As someone dealing with emotional pain,
I want to find articles and videos about emotional healing,
So that I can learn ways to recover and move forward.

User three as a man considering therapy but unsure:
I want to read success stories of others who have benefitted from therapy,
So that I can feel more confident about seeking professional help.




## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Man Cave Palette](<file path to palette image here>)

I chose this colour palette because I thought it combines a strong, modern look with the right balance of contrast and readability.


### Typography

Use this area to explain my choice of fonts.



### Imagery

Use this section to explain what sort of imagery you plan to use through your site.

### Wireframes

I made my wireframes using Balsamiq.

![Man Cave - Home](file path)

![Man Cave - Helpful tips](file path)



![Mobile Home](file path)

![Tablet Home](file path)

## Features

My site is made up of a Home page containing positive affirmations and Resources and the tips page containing videos with helpful advice.

### General features on each page

General features that reoccur on each page are the navbar, footer, favicon,

### Future Implementations


### Accessibility

In my project I have added.....


## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

* HTML
* CSS

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

* Balsamiq - To create the wireframes
* Git - For version control
* Github - To save and store my project
* Bootstrap 5.3 - The framework for my project, this was used for my header, the modal and the cards.
